genome-complexity.go:
	Compute various complexities of genomes, include repeat density, 
	distinct substring density, and I complexity.

Example:
	go run genome-complexity.go genome-file.fasta

train_n_test.py:

usage: train_n_test.py [-h] complexity aligners [aligners ...] [TRAIN_FRAC]

Train and predict short-read alignment performance using different complexity
measures.

positional arguments:
  complexity  file containing complexity values of genomes
  aligners    file(s) containing performance values of aligner
  TRAIN_FRAC  fraction of data used for training

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit


Example: using 40% of data for training, 60% for testing
	python train_n_test.py complexity.txt mrfast.txt seqalto.txt 0.4
